## Request a Component

1. First, add your React component to Optimizely.git so you aren't blocked by OUI to release this feature.
2. Get your component HTML/CSS reviewed by a UI Engineer for code quality (required). Or you can request we create the HTML.
2. Submit a JIRA ticket to UI Engineering that including:
  - Who designed this component? (We'll need to talk to them about documenting the use cases.)
  - Are there at least two use cases in the app currently? (More than two use cases means it's a good candidate for an OUI component; please attach screen shots.)
