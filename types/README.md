## Ê¦ Typescript Types

Types are auto generated using the Typescript CLI (`tsc`) and appended to the root template file (`templates/module-declaration.d.ts`) to generate the complete public facing type definition file (`index.d.ts`)

The concatenation process is necessary to provide a named export interface (similar to `src/main.js`) with autogenerated module definitions per file (generated by the `tsc` CLI).

See `yarn generate-types` for the commands we run to auto generate `index.d.ts`

I'd love if there was a cleaner way to do this!

## Adding or Updating Types

DO NOT MODIFY `index.d.ts` directly! It is an autogenerated file per above.

To add/edit component definitions, you should only change the module definition template (`templates/module-declaration.d.ts`).

`oui.d.ts` contains Typescript definitions specifically necessary for working inside this repo.
